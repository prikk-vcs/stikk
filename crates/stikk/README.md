# stikk

**stikk is a history browser and workbench for the [prikk](https://github.com/prikk-vcs/prikk)
version control system** — a terminal (TUI) front-end over one shared operation layer.

Its founding property is that **stikk owns no repository authority and no secrets**: every repository
fact is re-derived from prikk, and prikk — never stikk — reads signing key material. Its stance
mirrors prikk's own: *where prikk refuses, stikk explains.* The name is Norwegian for *to set a
course, to take a bearing.*

This binary crate is the launcher; the layers beneath it are published as
[`stikk-core`](https://crates.io/crates/stikk-core),
[`stikk-tui`](https://crates.io/crates/stikk-tui),
[`stikk-prikk`](https://crates.io/crates/stikk-prikk),
[`stikk-state`](https://crates.io/crates/stikk-state), and
[`stikk-model`](https://crates.io/crates/stikk-model).

## Install

```sh
cargo install stikk
```

**stikk drives the external `prikk` binary at runtime** (it is not a Cargo dependency): install a
compatible `prikk` on your `PATH` as well. This release requires prikk **≥ 0.28** and is validated
through **0.30.0**; a newer prikk still runs, but stikk says its output shapes have not been checked
against it rather than silently assuming they have. If `prikk` is missing, stikk opens and then
explains that — by design.

## Use

```sh
stikk [path]          # open the TUI on a repository (or discover upward from the cwd)
stikk config path     # print where stikk's own config and state live
stikk config check    # validate a config file
```

Piped or non-TTY invocation prints a one-shot orientation instead of opening the TUI.

## Status

**v0.1.x is a read-only preview**: orientation, ref history, block detail, worktree changes, and the
refusal-explanation / glossary surfaces. It performs no repository mutations yet — those land in later
increments, always preview-first with tiered confirmation.
