# stikk

**stikk is a history browser and workbench for the [prikk](https://github.com/nabbisen/prikk)
version control system** — a terminal (TUI) and graphical (GUI) front-end over one shared operation
layer. The name is Norwegian for *to set a course, to take a bearing.*

Its founding property, from which the whole design follows: **stikk owns no repository authority and
no secrets.** Every repository fact is re-derived from prikk, and prikk — never stikk — reads signing
key material. Its stance mirrors prikk's own: *where prikk refuses, stikk explains.*

- **Reviewing the design?** The reference section is the full design set, in the order the project's
  workflow produced it: [Requirements](./reference/requirements.md) →
  [External design](./reference/external-design.md) →
  [Internal design](./reference/internal-design.md), with the
  [Data model](./reference/data-model.md) and [Threat model](./reference/threat-model.md) beside them.

## Status

Foundation (0.1.0) plus the first interactive surface: the security-critical layers — the shared
model, the prikk seam, and the state layer — are implemented and tested, and the **interactive TUI**
(shell + Orientation view, built on `ratatui`, RFC 001) now opens on a terminal. Piped/CI invocation
keeps the one-shot orientation. History and Patch detail are the next increment.
